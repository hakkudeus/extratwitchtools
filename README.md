# extratwitchtools
A bunch of a random API Tools built by myself to work with Twitch.

Originally, it was used to call "followage" request to avoid from being done this in public chats AND to avoid chats command & message cooldown.
First version of original Windows .exe was published in April-May 2020 and was named "Followage Tool" (made with Delphi 7). 
It was updated only once, the next day, adding social links :D
Then I released Android version and have already made a ton of updates, until Fall 2021 when I retired this project.

This code belongs to May 2022 unreleased Windows version that should have become an update, but instead became an infinite WIP project.
AND It actually doesn't work because of Edge API that doesn't work for some reason.
